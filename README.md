This repository contains a collection of Java practice programs that cover fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.
The goal of this repo is to practice, learn, and share Java coding examples in a structured way.

📌 Contents:
- Basic Programs (loops, conditionals, arrays, strings)
- Object-Oriented Concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation)
- File Handling (FileReader, FileWriter, etc.)
- Exception Handling
- Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)
- Patterns & Number Programs
